# Day 45 Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

## Introduction to Web Scraping

Even though API (Application Programming Interface) is useful, but not every website has APIs that we can use, or their APIs do not let us do all the things we want to do.

As a solution, we can use web scraping to get information that we want from the website.

For example, an HTML parser is a useful tool to do that.

## What is HTML parser

HTML parser is a program/software by which useful statement can be extracted, leaving html tages (like `<h1>`, `<span>`, `<p>` etc.) behind.

## What is Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup is a Python package from parsing HTML and XML documents, including those with malformed markup.
