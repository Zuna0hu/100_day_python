# Day 16 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that helps break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, each of which can be handled by separate individuals or teams. By structuring code this way, functionalities become modular and reusable, allowing for scalable and maintainable codebases suited to complex projects.


## Why is OOP needed?
Without OOP, procedural programming can quickly become complex and challenging to manage, especially as projects grow. OOP helps organize code in a way that mimics real-world entities, making it easier to work collaboratively and maintain flexibility as project requirements evolve.
