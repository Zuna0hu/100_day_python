## How to Name a Class

To name a class in Python, it is common to use Pascal Case like `PascalCase`, with the first letters in the words being capitalized.

### Other Naming Methods
It is different from Camel Case like `camelCase`, where only the first word is in lowercase, but every subsequent word has its first letter capitalized.

Also, sometimes we can see vairables seperated by an underscore in Python, like `snake_case`.
