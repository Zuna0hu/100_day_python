# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

This is the repo with everything I have created along the way of following the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu. This course is designed to take anyone from beginner to professional Python developer with real-world projects every day.

## Course Overview

### Course Structure
- **100 Days of Code**: 1 hour per day for 100 days, with a new project each day.
- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Over 65 hours of video tutorials, covering Python basics to advanced applications in web development, data science, automation, and more.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Practical, real-world projects that build coding skills and understanding.

### Topics Covered
- **Python Programming**: Core syntax, scripting, and advanced concepts.
- **Web Development**: Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and Backend (Flask, REST APIs).
- **Data Science**: Analysis and visualization with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Automation**: Browser automation and web scraping with Selenium.
- **Game Development**: Building classic games like Snake and Pong.
- **Deployment**: Deploying apps on platforms like Heroku and GitHub Pages.

## Tools and Technologies
As you progress through the course, you will be working with:
- **Python 3**
- **PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab**
- **Flask, SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL**
- **Git & GitHub for Version Control**
- **Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup, Selenium**
- **Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Plotly**

## Example Projects
Some of the projects Iâ€™ll be building along the way include:
- Classic games like Blackjack and Pong
- Automation tools like a Tinder auto swiper and LinkedIn job application bot
- A personal blog and a public API
- Data analysis projects with Google Trends and App Store data

## Setup
- **Operating System**: Linux (Xubuntu virtual machine)
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Interpreter**: Python 3.10.12 64-bit (Linux built-in Python)
- **Virtual Environment**: Python 3.10.12 64-bit

## How to Create an Environment in VS Code
To set up a local Python environment in VS Code using either a virtual environment (Venv) or Anaconda, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type and select **Python: Create Environment**.

This command will present you with options for environment types: **Venv** or **Conda**. 

- **If you select Venv**, you'll be prompted to choose a Python interpreter to use as the base for your new virtual environment.

After creating the environment, remember to activate it before running your code. You can activate an environment in the Command Palette by selecting **Python: Select Interpreter** and choosing the environment you've created.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the official [VS Code Python environment tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).

## Remember to Add `.venv` and `__pycache__` to `.gitignore`
Make sure to add `.venv` and `__pycache__` to your `.gitignore` file. This prevents your virtual environment and Python's compiled bytecode files from being included in version control.

You can refer to the `.gitignore` file on how to exclude these directories.

## Course Goals
This repo is where I document my journey, track my progress, and showcase my learning as I work through the course.
