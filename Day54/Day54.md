# Introduction to Web Development with Flask

## Frontend vs Backend
### Frontend
- What users see:
  - **HTML**: Structure
  - **CSS**: Style
  - **JavaScript**: Interactivity
- Example: A simple static website.

### Backend
- Handles business logic, calculations, and dynamic functionalities.
- Technologies:
  - Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, etc.
  - Frameworks: Flask, Django (Python); Node.js (JavaScript).
- Flask:
  - Beginner-friendly.
  - Best for small projects.
- Django:
  - Ideal for large, commercial projects.

### Full-Stack Development
- Involves working with both **frontend** and **backend** technologies.

## Key Components of a Backend
1. **Client**
   - User's browser interacting with the website.
2. **Server**
   - A powerful computer that processes requests and sends responses.
3. **Database**
   - Stores data in a structured format (like a "souped-up spreadsheet").

## How Websites Work
1. User makes a request (e.g., entering a URL).
2. The **server** processes the request.
3. The server fetches data from the **database** if needed.
4. The server generates an HTML/CSS/JavaScript bundle and sends it to the **client**.
5. The browser renders the page for the user.

## Restaurant Analogy
- **Client**: Front of house where customers sit.
- **Server**: Kitchen where dishes are prepared.
- **Database**: Larder with stored ingredients.
